*GENTITY TOOL

Parent - Node





since the attributes in the xml can vary in position i.e; sometimes name can be the first attr in the entity node
sometimes desc can be first so there is a need to store the parsed in a struct to easily write to a file


therefore a struct is used to store a entity (its attrs, relations) 

* Supported generators
  + FLASK_SQL_ALCHEMY

+ relations supported
 + One to One
 + One To many
